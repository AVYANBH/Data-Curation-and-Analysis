# Data Curation and Analysis | Abhiyan Bhandari

##Goal: 

The objective of this data curation and analysis project is to explore and understand population trends in the United States by focusing on the top 100 most populated cities. Through visualization, the project aims to provide intuitive insights into the population growth and patterns within the country.

##Data Types: 

int = Population and Rank | String = Name and State

##Visualizations

This approach simplifies the dataset and narrows my scope to the most populous cities, enabling exploration of trends, patterns, or comparisons related to these specific columns. By concentrating on these key attributes, we can gain valuable insights into the dynamics and characteristics of the most populous cities, such as their growth prospects and their rankings relative to one another.

The first visualization focuses on the growth rate of the top 10 most populated cities. By plotting the growth rate against population, the graph provides a quick overview of how these cities are evolving. These insights lay the foundation for more in-depth analysis into the factors contributing to the attractiveness of these cities for relocation.

##Next Steps

For the next part of the project I want to conduct a more detailed analysis of the characteristics that make highly populated cities attractive for relocation.Explore additional visualizations to uncover patterns in population growth over time. Consider external factors such as economic indicators, job opportunities, and quality of life to enhance the understanding of population dynamics.
